first you'll need to upate using

"sudo apt uptade"

then Install some Dependencies using 

"sudo apt install build-essential openssl libssl-dev"

this installs the required development libraries so the program can compile and use OpenSSL hashing 

after this you need Create project directory 

"mkdir file_integrity"

and then create a source file 

"nano monitor.cpp"

then after writing the code for monitor.cpp (provided)

compile the program 

"g++ monitor.cpp -std=c++17 -lssl -lcrypto -o monitor" this command compiles your program and creates an executable file

#g++ → C++ compiler
#monitor.cpp → your source code file
#-std=c++17 → compiles using C++17 standard
#-lssl -lcrypto → links OpenSSL libraries required for SHA-256 hashing
#-o monitor → names the output executable monitor

Then create a monitored directory eg testdir so,
"mkdir testdir" 
"echo hello > testdir/a.txt" implies we made some changes in the test directory

now run the executable file created earlier in this case namer monitor 

this creates initial hash database named : hashes.txt :

now lets make changes in the test directory so program can dtetect and report them 
"echo changed >> testdir/a.txt" 
now run the executable 
"./monitor"

this will create a text file named : security_log.txt :
this file will note down the changes in the directory like when and at what time the modifications were made

NOW, this is optional: 
if we want we can Schedule execution of the monitor file every hour we can use cron tab
"crontab -e" 
and add the line: 
"0 * * * * /<file address>/<username>/<directory name>/<exe filename>"
in this case: " 0 * * * * /home/admin_user/file_integrity/monitor"

# 0 → run at minute 0
# * → every hour
# * → every day
# * → every month
# * → every day of week

Hence, Linux automatically run the executable files modifying security_log.txt if any changes made
